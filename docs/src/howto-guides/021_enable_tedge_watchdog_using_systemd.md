# Watchdog feature using `systemd` in `thin-edge.io`

## Introduction

`Watchdog` feature is used to check the health of a service/process by constantly exchanging
the message between the watchdog process and the service/process that is being monitored.
When the process does not update its health status within a specified `time` period, then the watchdog process will
restart the service that is being monitored.

This document shows how `thin-edge.io` services are managed using the systemd, then one can use `systemd`
feature to check the health of these services as well. This document provides
information about how to use `systemd` for checking the health of the services.

## Enabling the `watchdog` feature in `systemd`

Enabling the `watchdog` feature in systemd for a `thin-edge.io` service (tedge_agent, tedge_mapper_c8y/az/collectd)
using the `systemd` is a two-step process.

### Step 1: Enable the `watchdog` feature in the `systemd` service file
For example to enable the `watchdog` feature for `tedge-mapper-c8y` service, update systemd service file as shown below.

Add `tedge_watchdog.service` in  `After` under `[Unit]` section.
Add `WatchdogSec=5` under `[Service]` section.

The sample service file after updating looks as below.

```shell
[Unit]
Description=tedge-mapper-c8y converts Thin Edge JSON measurements to Cumulocity JSON format.
After=syslog.target network.target mosquitto.service tedge_watchdog.service

[Service]
User=tedge-mapper
ExecStart=/usr/bin/tedge_mapper c8y
Restart=on-failure
RestartPreventExitStatus=255
WatchdogSec=5
```

> Note: The systemd service file usually present in `/lib/systemd/system/tedge-mapper-c8y.service`.

### Step 2: Start the `tedge-watchdog` service

Start the `watchdog` service as below.
```shell
systemctl start tedge-watchdog.service
```

Now the `tedge-watchdog` service will be keep sending health check messages for every `WatchdogSec/2` seconds.
Once the response is received from the particular service, the `watchdog` service will send the notification
to the systemd on behalf of the service.

## Debugging
One can observe the message exchange between the `service` and the `watchdog` by subscribing to `tedge/health/#` and `tedge/health-check/#` topics.

> Note: If the watchdog service did not send the notification to the systemd within `WatchdogSec`, then the systemd will kill the existing service process and restarts it.
