# How to monitor health of tedge daemons

The health of tedge daemon processes like `tedge-mapper`, `tedge-agent` etc can be monitored via MQTT.
These daemons expose MQTT health endpoints which you can query to check if the process is still active or not.

The health endpoints conform to the following topic scheme, listening for health check requests:

`tedge/health-check/<tedge-daemon-name>`

expecting empty messages, triggering the health check.

The daemon will then respond back on the topic:

`tedge/health/<tedge-daemon-name>`

with the following payload:

```json
{ "status": "up" }
```

## Supported MQTT topic endpoints

The following endpoints are currently supported by various tedge daemons:

* `tedge/health/tedge-agent`
* `tedge/health/tedge-mapper-c8y`
* `tedge/health/tedge-mapper-az`
* `tedge/health/tedge-mapper-collectd`

All future tedge daemons will also follow the same topic naming scheme convention.
