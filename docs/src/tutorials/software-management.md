# Introduction

This document describes how to install and use the **Software management** feature in thin-edge.io.

> Note: As of now the software management only supports **debian** based distros(Ex: Ubuntu, Debian),
 which use the **apt**.



## Download and Install software management packages on the device

As a prequisite, install [tedge and tedge_mapper](../howto-guides/002_installation.md) if not installed already. 

The thin-edge software management packages are in repository on GitHub: [thin-edge.io](https://github.com/thin-edge/thin-edge.io/releases).

To download the package from github repository use the following command (use desired version):

```shell
curl -LJO https://github.com/thin-edge/thin-edge.io/releases/download/<package>_<version>_<arch>.deb
```

where:
> `version` -> thin-edge.io software management components version in x.x.x format
>
> `arch` -> architecture type (amd64, armhf)

Download `tedge_apt_plugin` and `tedge_agent`

```shell
curl -LJO https://github.com/thin-edge/thin-edge.io/releases/download/0.3.0/tedge_apt_plugin_0.3.0_amd64.deb
curl -LJO https://github.com/thin-edge/thin-edge.io/releases/download/0.3.0/tedge_agent_0.3.0_amd64.deb
```

Now the packages are downloaded, proceed to installation.
> Note: Some OSes may require you to use `sudo` to install packages and therefore all following commands may need `sudo`.

To install `tedge_apt_plugin` and `tedge_agent` on thin-edge device do:

```shell
dpkg -i tedge_apt_plugin_<version>_<arch>.deb
dpkg -i tedge_agent<version>_<arch>.deb
```



## Start and enable the software management services

The `tedge connect` will automatically start and enable the software management services.
Find more about [how to connect thin-edge device to cloud](../howto-guides/004_connect.md)

Once the thin-edge device is successfully connected to Cumulocity cloud, the **Software** option will be enabled and
the list of softwares that are installed on the device will be visible as shown in the figure below.
